        <h2 class="page-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>For my Web Scripting II project, I turned a collection of 
            recipe PDFs into a website with filters and a search bar
            using PHP and MySQL. The goal was to move from static documents to a digital 
            interface where it would enhance the user experience by allowing them to browse, update, 
            and use it on different devices. The final product was a fully functioning recipe 
            database developed in VSCode with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
            and man aged through GitHub. It was also developed locally in MAMP with VS Code, 
            and then deployed to Drexel’s hosting environment using Cyberduck and PHPmyAdmin.</p>
    
        <h2 class="page-title">Context and Challenge</h2>
        <h3>Background: </h3>
        <p>My final project for this class focuses on building a recipe website using MySQL and PHP. 
            The project is an individual assignment and is part of a scripting course for web development.  
            Over the course of 10 weeks, only three assignments helped 
            in the production of my final project: Alpha, Beta, and Final Project</p>
        <p>Developed on a zero-cost budget, the project aimed to give students practical experience with modern 
            design concepts and back-end scripting. It met the course goals by handling user input, managing 
            databases, and implementing advanced authentication. Throughout the project, I built a strong 
            understanding of server-side programming and learned to apply modern development tools effectively.</p>
        <h3>Problem: </h3>
            <p>The original recipe PDFs made it difficult to quickly find content, browse categories, or 
            search through all 37 recipes, and some were missing resources or context. 
            With no filtering or querying capabilities, the assignment required building a backend system capable 
            of organizing and retrieving the content dynamically. At the same time, the provided ZIP file of 
            recipes was messy and overwhelming, filled with unstructured text, unoptimized images, and inconsistent 
            formatting. It was a learning curve as this was my first time work with front-end development with PHP and MySQL for the 
            especially with dozens of recipe pages within 10 weeks. Not only were there limitations of the original PDFs but 
            also the challenge of learning server-side programming while managing a large volume of disorganized content.</p>
        <h3>Goals & Objectives: </h3>
            <p>The project required converting all recipe PDFs into structured digital data and storing them in 
            a MySQL database capable of organizing categories, listing ingredients, and displaying recipe details. From there,
             I needed to build a user-friendly front end that improved readability and accessibility while enabling fast
              browsing and searching—features the original PDFs couldn’t offer. To support this functionality, I 
              also created an API that delivered all recipe information in JSON format and hosted the final website 
              publicly on Drexel’s servers.</p>
        <h2 class="page-title">Process and Insight</h2>
        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>This project is designed for anyone who enjoys browsing online recipes, 
                whether they’re new to cooking or seasoned in the kitchen. I aimed to 
                create an simple, easy-to-use platform with straightforward features 
                like a search bar and protein filters for smoother 
                browsing.</p>
        <h3>Database</h3>
            <p>Because the original content were only in PDF format, each recipe's content was manually 
                transcribed into a structured format on Google Sheets to organize the content into
                the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recipe ID Number</li>
                <li>Recipe Title</li>
                <li>Recipe Subheading</li>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>Ingredients List</li>
                <li>Instruction Steps</li>
                <li>Image File Names</li>
                <li>Mobile Image File Names</li>
                <li>Protein Tag</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Google Sheets document was exported as a .csv file which was then imported into 
                phpMyAdmin to test and modify fields as the data evolved locally on MAMP. 
                I utilized asterisks in between each recipe steps to separate them 
                with the PHP command “explode”.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Before coding in PHP, I started with a template using HTML and CSS on VS Code to create my layout
                and making it responsive. After that I converted the HTML files into PHP files. 
                PHP was useful in repeated elements, like recipe cards and the contents within the recipe pages
                making it much easier and quicker to create recipe pages and cards for as many recipes I can add to the database.</p>
            <h3>Final Project</h3>
                <p>To deploy my website, Cyberduck was used to upload the project to Drexel’s public server. 
                    The MySQL database was exported from the localhost, and the SQL file was imported to Drexel's live hosting server through their 
                    PHPmyAdmin.</p>
            
            <h2 class="page-title">The Solution</h2>

            <p>The website lays out all the recipes from the database in a organized way. The filter and search bar are at the top
                and displayed so that users can easily select a filter or reset the filter to catorgize the recipes or search for a certain recipe.
                The website is responsive so that it is accessible and responsive on all devices.
            </p>

            <h2 class="page-title">The Results</h2>
            <p>This 10-week project significantly expanded my understanding of full-stack development. I learned how to design 
                and integrate a database from scratch, structure content for accessibility, and deploy a live site—skills 
                I had no prior experience with. Working through data cleanup, PHP integration, and server hosting gave me 
                a clearer sense of how dynamic web applications function behind the scenes.</p>
            <p>The project also strengthened my time-management and project-planning abilities. Looking back, 
                documenting feedback and following a more structured cycle of research, testing, and design would have 
                made the process more efficient. Still, the experience proved how even simple content can benefit from 
                intentional structure and thoughtful design, and it sparked a deeper curiosity about how data moves through 
                a system—insight I’ll carry into future projects.</p>
